Keyboard Shortcuts
Description: Add shortcuts (e.g., Ctrl+Shift+I to open popup, Enter to inject) for faster interaction.
Implementation:
Use chrome.commands in manifest.json to define shortcuts.
Handle commands in background.js to trigger popup actions.
Benefit: Speeds up developer workflows.
Effort: Medium (requires manifest and background script updates).
